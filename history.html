            <strong> Hans Max Gamper-Haessig</strong> (born 22 November 1877
            died 30 July 1930), commonly known as Joan Gamper, was a Swiss-born
            football executive and versatile athlete. <br />He founded football
            clubs in Switzerland and Spain, most notably FC Barcelona and FC
            Zürich. He is widely regarded as one of the most important figures
            in the amateur beginnings of FC Barcelona, being the fundamental
            head behind the foundation of the club in 1899, and then serving as
            the club's first captain between 1899 and 1903, netting over 100
            goals in just 48 matches for Barça and in 1902, he captained his
            side to a victory in the Copa Macaya, the club's very first title.
            He then served as its <br />president on five separate occasions
            between 1908 and 1925. One of his main achievements was getting the
            funds for the construction of their own stadium in 1909, the Camp de
            la Indústria, which is regarded as the main element that helped the
            club grow in the 1910s. Under Gamper's leadership, Barcelona won
            eleven Championat de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees
            Cup. <br /><br />

            In 1899, Gamper went to Barcelona to visit his uncle who was living
            there. He was on his way to Africa to help set up some sugar trading
            companies but fell in love with the Catalan city and decided to stay
            put. He would later become a fluent Catalan speaker and adopt the
            Catalan version of his name: "Joan Gamper". As an accountant, he
            found work with Crédit Lyonnais, the Sarrià Railway Company and as a
            sports columnist, he worked for two Swiss newspapers. Gamper joined
            the local Swiss Evangelical Church and began playing football within
            the local Christian Protestant community in the district of
            Sarrià-Sant Gervasi. During his free time, he also played football
            with a group of friends at the Velódromo de la Bonanova. When
            Gamper, who had already founded clubs in his home country, decided
            to do the same in his new city, he contacted Jaime Vila, the
            director of the Tolosa gym, which at the time was the home to a
            group of football enthusiasts that was also practicing the sport in
            Bonanova. He proposed to him the idea of creating a well-organized
            football club, but Vila rejected him as he did not want foreigners
            in its ranks and ended up founding Català FC in October 1899. This
            did not discourage him, however, with Gamper now aiming to create an
            organization that was open to everyone, regardless of their origin.
            He envisaged a club that served as a means of social integration, in
            which everyone could speak their mind, and create a democratic
            society that was freely governed by its members. Immediately
            afterwards, he and his friend Walter Wild arrived at the Gimnasio
            Solé. There they were well received by Narciso Masferrer, who had
            the headquarters of his numerous associations and of the Los
            Deportes newsroom in the said gym, and they did not take long to
            publish Gamper's infamous advert declaring his wish to form a
            football club, published on 22 October 1899. A positive response
            resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November and
            "Futbol Club Barcelona" was born. The founders included a collection
            of Swiss, British, and Spanish enthusiasts. It is not known if
            Gamper chose the legendary club colours, blaugrana, after FC Basel
            or Excelsior Zürich, although the official version states that
            brothers Arthur and Ernest Witty (both very involved with the club
            in its first years) proposed the blaugrana colors, the same used by
            the rugby team of Merchant Taylors' School in Great Crosby (which
            they had attended).

            <strong> Hendrik Johannes Cruijff</strong>, internationally known as
            Johan Cruyff (born:25 April 1947, died: 24 March 2016) was a Dutch
            professional football player and manager. Regarded as one of the
            greatest players of all time, and as the greatest Dutch footballer
            ever, he won the Ballon d'Or three times, in 1971, 1973, and 1974.
            In the 1970s, Dutch football rose from near obscurity to become a
            powerhouse in the sport. Cruyff led the Netherlands to the final of
            the 1974 FIFA World Cup and received the Golden Ball as player of
            the tournament. At the 1974 finals, he executed a feint that
            subsequently was named after him, the "Cruyff Turn", a move widely
            replicated in the modern game. He was a football visionary whose
            impact on FC Barcelona & Ajax Amsterdam as both a player and coach
            revolutionized the club's style of play and left an enduring legacy
            in the annals of football history.<br />

            Cruyff made a momentous move to Barcelona from Ajax Amsterdam,
            setting the stage for a historic chapter in the Catalan club's
            history. The Dutch maestro quickly became a darling of the Camp Nou
            faithful, mesmerizing fans with his exceptional skills, breathtaking
            dribbling, and unparalleled vision on the pitch. Cruyff's ability to
            read the game and execute precise passes made him a dynamic
            playmaker, orchestrating Barcelona's attacking moves with unrivaled
            finesse. During his first three seasons with Barcelona, Cruyff led
            the team to secure a La Liga title and Copa del Rey triumph,
            showcasing his immense influence on the pitch. He was not only a
            prolific goal-scorer but also an architect of intricate team play,
            elevating the entire squad's performance. Cruyff's revolutionary
            concept, known as "Total Football," which he learned at Ajax under
            Rinus Michels, started to shape Barcelona's identity. The philosophy
            involved fluid positioning, intelligent interchange of positions,
            and a strong emphasis on possession-based attacking football. Under
            Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona transformed into a force to be reckoned
            with, and his impact on the club's ethos would continue long after
            his playing days. <br /><br />

            Following his illustrious playing career, Cruyff returned to
            Barcelona in 1988, this time as the head coach, and embarked on a
            remarkable journey that would forever alter the footballing
            landscape in Catalonia. Embracing the principles of Total Football,
            Cruyff instilled a strong sense of tactical discipline and
            creativity within the team. The 1988-89 season was historic for
            Barcelona as they secured a La Liga title after an intense title
            race with Real Madrid. But it was in the early '90s when Cruyff's
            "Dream Team" reached its peak. Led by the mesmerizing skills of
            players like Romário, Ronald Koeman, and Pep Guardiola, Barcelona
            achieved unprecedented success both domestically and
            internationally. In the 1991-92 season, Cruyff guided Barcelona to
            their first-ever European Cup triumph, beating Sampdoria in the
            final 1-0. This victory cemented Barcelona's status as a European
            football powerhouse and validated Cruyff's tactical genius.
            Moreover, Cruyff's influence extended beyond the playing field. He
            played a crucial role in revitalizing Barcelona's youth academy, La
            Masia, emphasizing the development of young talents and instilling a
            footballing philosophy that would become synonymous with the club.
            Legacy Johan Cruyff's impact on Barcelona extended far beyond
            trophies and titles. His influence was cultural, transforming the
            way football was perceived and played. The style he cultivated at
            Barcelona would become part of the club's DNA, influencing future
            generations of players and coaches. Cruyff's spirit continues to be
            honored through the annual presentation of the "Johan Cruyff
            Trophy," awarded to the best player in the Dutch Eredivisie. Sadly,
            on March 24, 2016, football lost one of its greatest luminaries when
            Johan Cruyff passed away. However, his legacy remains alive and
            well, as his footballing philosophy and principles continue to
            inspire clubs and coaches worldwide, perpetuating the lasting impact
            of the maestro's genius.

            <strong>Franklin Edmundo Rijkaard</strong> (born 30 September 1962)
            is a Dutch former footballer and former manager who played as a
            defensive midfielder. Rijkaard played for Ajax, Real Zaragoza, and
            AC Milan and represented the Netherlands national team side 73
            times, scoring 10 goals. In his managerial career, he was at the
            helm of the Netherlands national team, Sparta Rotterdam, Barcelona,
            Galatasaray, and the Saudi Arabia national team. He was regarded as
            one of the best midfielders in football history. <br />
            Rijkaard's coaching career began when he was appointed manager of
            the Netherlands national team in 1998. He had previously served as
            an assistant coach, along with Johan Neeskens and Ronald Koeman
            under the managerial tenure of Guus Hiddink. At the time, he was not
            taken seriously as a manager because of his inexperience, but he was
            able to guide his national side to the semi-finals of Euro 2000.
            During the group phase, the Dutch team won slowly but surely and
            managed to get three victories: 1–0 against the Czech Republic, 3–0
            against Denmark and 3–2 against France. In the quarter-final, his
            side produced the biggest win of the competition, a 6–1 result
            against Yugoslavia. The Netherlands played some of the best football
            of the tournament, but lost their semi-final match to Italy on
            penalties; Rijkaard resigned immediately. During the 2001–02 season,
            he became manager of Sparta Rotterdam in the Eredivisie, the oldest
            professional team in the country. Rijkaard enjoyed the down-to-earth
            atmosphere, although the club was not financially strong. Under his
            leadership, the club was relegated to the second division for the
            first time in its history, and he was consequently sacked. <br />
            <br />
            Rijkaard was not out of a coaching role for long, and less than a
            year after leaving Sparta, he was appointed manager of Barcelona for
            the 2003–04 season, with Albert Roca as the assistant coach. The
            season would prove to be a watershed for the club, but not without
            initial instability. Rijkaard arrived at the club as it entered a
            new phase, having elected a new president in Joan Laporta and a new
            managerial board, but with fans unhappy that Laporta had let English
            midfielder David Beckham snub the chance to join the club. For
            Rijkaard, the team he inherited, with the exception of new superstar
            signing Ronaldinho (who was the club's second choice after Beckham),
            also consisted of many underachieving players from the old guard and
            era that failed to meet the club and its fans' demands to match
            archrival Real Madrid's success in the early 2000s, having not won a
            trophy since 1999. Rijkaard had a disappointing start at Barcelona
            that saw some sections of the club's fans call for his resignation,
            and he drew flak from the media when the team lost to Real Madrid in
            December 2003. Rijkaard's resilience won through and from 2004
            onwards, he achieved a massive turnaround, as the team went from
            strength to strength. Barcelona finished runners-up in La Liga in
            2003–04, having been close to the relegation zone at one point in
            the earlier stages of the season. Rijkaard then took Barcelona to
            the next level as he phased out the old guard and rebuilt a new-look
            side around Ronaldinho, with new players like Deco, Samuel Eto'o,
            Rafael Márquez and Ludovic Giuly, along with the latest promotion of
            some young players from the previous era trained in the club's youth
            teams, including Víctor Valdés, Lionel Messi and Andrés Iniesta. He
            eventually succeeded in turning around the fortunes of the club,
            with the strong support of Laporta, and within the next couple of
            years finally managed to win La Liga both in 2004–05 and in 2005–06.
            <br />
            <br />

            Rijkaard became the first Barcelona coach to have won twice at Real
            Madrid's Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, an achievement which even
            successful managers like Johan Cruyff, Louis van Gaal and Luis
            Aragonés were unable to accomplish. His no-nonsense policy on and
            off the field, and the sparkling football played by his team, won
            him many plaudits and Rijkaard was among the five nominated coaches
            for UEFA's Team of the Year 2005. On 8 March 2006, he was also
            honoured by UEFA for his contributions to the European Cup
            competition throughout his career as player and manager. Rijkaard
            also achieved success on the European stage, winning the 2005–06
            Champions League with a 2–1 win against Arsenal in the final.
            Barcelona had been losing 1–0 for most of the match before his late
            tactical substitutions proved the decisive factor, as the
            introduction of Henrik Larsson and Juliano Belletti contributed
            directly to Barcelona's two goals. The win made him the fifth
            individual to have won the European Cup both as a player and as a
            manager, alongside Miguel Muñoz, Giovanni Trapattoni, Johan Cruyff
            and Carlo Ancelotti, a feat later achieved also by his eventual
            successor, Pep Guardiola and then Zinedine Zidane. <br /><br />
            After losing to Manchester United in the semi-final of the 2007–08
            Champions League, Rijkaard was asked whether he would quit at the
            end of the season, since he had not won anything for two successive
            seasons. He replied, "I have no intention of leaving. It would be
            different if the players were saying it is time for me to go but
            that is not the case." On 1 May 2008, it was reported that Rijkaard
            allegedly confided to a colleague that he would be stepping down as
            Barcelona manager at the end of the season, but 24 hours later, he
            stated in a press conference that he had no intention of leaving the
            club. On 8 May 2008, the day after Barcelona's dismal 4–1 defeat to
            archrivals Real Madrid, Barcelona president Joan Laporta announced
            that at the end of the 2007–08 season, Rijkaard would no longer be
            head coach of the first team. Laporta made the announcement after a
            board meeting, and Rijkaard was succeeded by Pep Guardiola. Laporta
            made it clear that Rijkaard's achievements "made history" and
            praised him for his time at the club.

            <br /><br /><br />
            <strong> Ronaldo de Assis Moreira</strong> (born 21 March 1980),
            commonly known as Ronaldinho Gaúcho, born in 1980, is a retired
            Brazilian footballer celebrated for his exceptional skills and
            versatility on the field. He is widely considered one of the
            greatest players in history, winning two FIFA World Player of the
            Year awards and a Ballon d'Or. His unique style included dazzling
            dribbles, precise free-kicks, imaginative passes, and remarkable
            goals, influenced by his futsal background. <br /><br />
            Ronaldinho achieved a rare feat of winning major titles like the
            World Cup, Copa América, Confederations Cup, Champions League, Copa
            Libertadores, and Ballon d'Or. In 2003, Ronaldinho joined FC
            Barcelona, chosen over other prominent players, marking the
            beginning of his peak years. He made a memorable debut, showcasing
            his extraordinary abilities. Despite early injury setbacks, he
            contributed significantly with 15 La Liga goals in the 2003–04
            season, aiding Barcelona's second-place finish. Ronaldinho's iconic
            no-look pass set the stage for a pivotal win against Real Madrid, a
            turning point in the team's resurgence. <br /><br />
            The subsequent 2004–05 season saw Ronaldinho clinching his first
            league title and being named FIFA World Player of the Year. His
            captivating performances in La Liga and the UEFA Champions League
            captured global attention. While Barcelona was eliminated from the
            Champions League by Chelsea, Ronaldinho's sublime goals left a
            lasting impression, especially a memorable strike against Chelsea.
            Ronaldinho's impact continued with key contributions to his team's
            successes. <br /><br />
            He garnered numerous awards in 2005, solidifying his status as the
            world's best player. Notably, he secured his only Ballon d'Or title.
            His exceptional skills were acknowledged even by rival fans, as seen
            when Real Madrid supporters applauded his performance during El
            Clásico. <br /><br />
            Ronaldinho played a pivotal role in Barcelona's Champions League
            triumph in 2006, scoring crucial goals in the knockout stages and
            assisting in the final. This achievement was complemented by
            securing La Liga again, marking his first career double. <br />
            <br />Teaming up with striker Samuel Eto'o, Ronaldinho's assists and
            goals bolstered Barcelona's dominance. He finished the season with
            26 goals and received accolades like UEFA Team of the Year and UEFA
            Club Footballer of the Year. He was also shortlisted for the Laureus
            World Sportsman of the Year and included in the FIFA World XI.
            Ronaldinho's career was characterized by his extraordinary skill
            set, significant contributions to Barcelona's success, and global
            recognition as a footballing wizard.

            <strong>Josep "Pep" Guardiola Sala</strong> (born 18 January 1971)
            is a Spanish professional football manager and former player.
            Currently managing Premier League club Manchester City, Guardiola is
            the only manager to win the continental treble twice, the youngest
            to win the UEFA Champions League, and he also holds the records for
            the most consecutive league games won in La Liga, the Bundesliga,
            and the Premier League. He is considered to be one of the greatest
            managers of all time. <br /><br />
            Guardiola was a defensive midfielder who usually played in a
            deep-lying playmaker's role. He spent the majority of his career
            with Barcelona, forming a part of Johan Cruyff's Dream Team that won
            the club's first European Cup in 1992, and four successive Spanish
            league titles from 1991 to 1994. He captained the team from 1997
            until his departure from Barcelona in 2001. Guardiola then had
            stints with Brescia and Roma in Italy, Al-Ahli in Qatar and Dorados
            de Sinaloa in Mexico. He was capped 47 times for the Spanish
            national team and appeared at the 1994 FIFA World Cup, as well as at
            UEFA Euro 2000. He also played friendly matches for Catalonia. After
            retiring as a player, Guardiola briefly managed Barcelona B, with
            whom he won a Tercera División title. He took charge of the first
            team in 2008. In his first season, he led Barcelona to the
            continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA
            Champions League, becoming the youngest manager to win the latter
            competition. He was named the FIFA World Coach of the Year in 2011
            after leading the club to another La Liga and Champions League
            double in the 2010–11 season. Guardiola ended his four-year
            Barcelona stint in 2012 with 14 honours, a club record. <br /><br />
            Guardiola was appointed manager of Barcelona B on 21 June 2007 with
            Tito Vilanova as his assistant. Under his guidance, the team
            subsequently won their Tercera División group and qualified for the
            2008 Segunda División B playoffs, which the team won, thereby
            achieving promotion. FC Barcelona President Joan Laporta announced
            in May 2008 that Guardiola would be appointed manager of the senior
            Barcelona squad to replace Frank Rijkaard at the end of the 2007–08
            season. <br /><br />

            Upon being appointed, Guardiola said that Ronaldinho, Deco, Samuel
            Eto'o and others were not part of his plans for the coming season.
            By the time of the announcement, he had already offloaded full back
            Gianluca Zambrotta to Milan, attacking midfielder Giovani dos Santos
            to Tottenham Hotspur and midfielder Edmílson to Villarreal. Deco
            went to Chelsea while Ronaldinho joined Zambrotta in Milan. Lilian
            Thuram was initially set to join Paris Saint-Germain on a free
            transfer, but the discovery of a heart condition put a stop to the
            move, and the veteran retired to tend to his health. Oleguer signed
            with Ajax, Santiago Ezquerro was released by Barcelona and Marc
            Crosas was sold to Celtic. The fate of Eto'o took much of the summer
            to unravel, with the Cameroonian linked with several clubs, but
            Guardiola finally declared that he would stay after his dedication
            in training and participation in the pre-season. <br /><br />

            In association with Barcelona Director of Sport Txiki Begiristain,
            several new signings were made by Guardiola – Dani Alves and Seydou
            Keita arrived from Sevilla; Martín Cáceres from Villarreal by way of
            Recreativo de Huelva; Gerard Piqué returned from Manchester United;
            and Alexander Hleb was signed from Arsenal. Henrique was also signed
            from Palmeiras, but was immediately loaned out to Bayer Leverkusen.
            In interviews with the press, Guardiola stressed a harder work ethic
            than before, but also a more personal approach during training and a
            closer relationship with his players. Along with the new signings,
            Guardiola promoted canteranos Sergio Busquets, Pedro and Jeffrén to
            the first-team squad.<br /><br />

            Guardiola's first competitive game as manager was in the third
            qualifying round of the Champions League, in which Barcelona
            comfortably beat Polish club Wisła Kraków 4–0 in the first leg at
            home. They then lost 1–0 in the second leg, but progressed with a
            4–1 aggregate victory. Promoted Numancia also defeated Barcelona in
            the opening matchday of the 2008–09 La Liga, but the team then went
            on an undefeated streak for over 20 matches to move to the top of
            the league. Barcelona maintained their spot atop La Liga's table,
            securing their first league title since 2006 when rivals Real Madrid
            lost at Villarreal on 16 May 2009. The most important match,
            however, was on 2 May when they defeated Real Madrid 6–2 at the
            Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. The league title was the second piece of
            silverware in Guardiola's first season at the club. Earlier, on 13
            May, Barcelona won the 2008–09 Copa del Rey, beating Athletic Bilbao
            4–1 in the 2009 Copa del Rey final.<br /><br />

            In the Champions League semi-final against Chelsea, a late Andrés
            Iniesta goal in the second leg at Stamford Bridge put Barcelona
            through, with an ecstatic Guardiola celebrating the goal by
            sprinting down the touchline near to where his players were
            celebrating. In the final of the Champions League, Barcelona beat
            Manchester United 2–0. In doing so, they became the first Spanish
            club to win the domestic cup, the league, and the European club
            titles (the treble) in the same season. The treble-winning season is
            regarded as one of the club's finest in its history. Furthermore, he
            became the youngest man to manage a Champions League winning team,
            at age 37. <br /><br />

            Guardiola's third season in charge saw the departure of two players
            who had arrived last season: Dmytro Chyhrynskyi returned to Shakhtar
            Donetsk and Zlatan Ibrahimović joined Milan on loan. Rafael Márquez
            and Thierry Henry were released from their contracts and both moved
            to New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer (MLS); Yaya Touré also
            left the team and moved to English Premier League club Manchester
            City. Barcelona signed Adriano from Sevilla, David Villa from
            Valencia and Javier Mascherano from Liverpool. On 14 July 2010,
            Guardiola signed a new contract to stay with Barcelona until June
            2011.<br /><br />

            On 21 August, Barcelona beat Sevilla 5–3 on aggregate to win the
            2010 Supercopa de España, his second in a row. On 29 November 2010,
            Barcelona beat Real Madrid 5–0, giving Guardiola five straight wins
            in El Clásico. On 8 February 2011, Guardiola accepted the club's
            offer for a one-year deal extension, signing a contract until June
            2012. On 16 February, in the first leg Champions League's first
            knockout round, Barcelona were defeated by Arsenal 2–1 at Emirates
            Stadium. The defeat prolonged Guardiola's record of never having won
            the away leg of a Champions League knockout tie. On 8 March, in the
            second leg of the Champions League first knockout round, Barcelona
            defeated Arsenal 3–1, thus winning 4–3 on aggregate, moving them
            into the quarter-finals.<br /><br />

            Early April saw Barcelona move eight points clear of second-placed
            Real Madrid in their domestic league after a key away win against
            Villarreal, making the most of Real Madrid's home loss against
            Sporting de Gijón earlier on the same day. Barcelona managed to
            advance to the semi-finals of the Champions League for the fourth
            year – last three under Guardiola – in a row after thrashing
            Shakhtar Donetsk 6–1 on aggregate.<br /><br />

            Barcelona continued their La Liga crusade for the second El Clásico
            in the Santiago Bernabéu, which ended 1–1. Lionel Messi scored for
            his team from the penalty spot after Raúl Albiol was sent off. Real
            Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo later replied from the penalty spot in
            the 80th minute of the match. Guardiola suffered his first final
            defeat during the Copa del Rey final against Real Madrid. Cristiano
            Ronaldo scored the only goal in the 103rd minute of the match during
            extra time, giving the club its first title since 2008, as well as
            José Mourinho's first title for his new club. In the Champions
            League, however, Barcelona beat Real Madrid 2–0 at the Bernabéu in
            the semi-final first leg, and after a 1–1 draw at Camp Nou, they
            proceeded to Guardiola's second Champions League final in three
            years as manager for Barcelona.<br /><br />

            On 11 May 2011, Barcelona won the La Liga title and the club's third
            in a row after a 1–1 draw with Levante. On 28 May, Barcelona beat
            Manchester United 3–1 at Wembley Stadium in the 2011 Champions
            League final.<br /><br />

            Guardiola's fourth season in charge started with the departure of
            three long-serving Barcelona players: Gabriel Milito moved back to
            old Argentine club Independiente, Jeffrén was sold to Sporting CP
            and Bojan was sold to Roma. Two high-profile signings were made:
            Alexis Sánchez came from Udinese for €26 million plus bonuses, and
            Cesc Fàbregas, a former La Masia graduate, returned from Arsenal for
            €29 million plus bonuses. To complete the squad, two players were
            promoted from the youth system: Thiago and Andreu Fontàs. The season
            started with a 5–4 aggregate win over Real Madrid for the Supercopa
            de España.<br /><br />

            Barcelona won their second trophy of the season on 26 August,
            beating Porto 2–0 in the 2011 UEFA Super Cup. With the trophy won
            against Porto, he became all-time record holder of most titles won
            as a manager at Barcelona. He won 12 trophies in only three years.
            November of the same year saw Guardiola manager his 200th match for
            Barcelona's first team. His record stood at 144 wins, 39 draws and
            17 losses with 500 goals for and 143 against.<br /><br />

            Barcelona ended the 2011 calendar year winning the Club World Cup,
            beating Brazilian club Santos 4–0 in the final, the widest margin in
            an Intercontinental Cup/Club World Cup final since changing to a
            single-match format. This was Guardiola's 13th title of only 16
            tournaments played. On 9 January 2012, he was named FIFA World Coach
            of the Year. On his 41st birthday, he led his side to a 2–1 victory
            over arch-rivals Real Madrid in El Clásico, ensuring that he
            remained unbeaten against Real Madrid in regular time as a manager.
            On 21 April, Guardiola conceded the league title to leaders Real
            Madrid after they beat Barcelona 2–1 and extended their lead in the
            table to seven points with four matches remaining. "We have to
            congratulate Madrid for their win and the title that they have also
            won tonight," said Guardiola, after what was his side's first loss
            at home all season.<br /><br />

            On 24 April, a 2–2 draw at home against Chelsea in the second leg of
            the Champions League semi-final knocked Barcelona out of the
            competition on a 2–3 aggregate score. That effectively left the team
            with only the Copa del Rey to play for. Guardiola had faced
            criticism over his recent tactics and squad selections. On 27 April
            2012, he announced he would step down as Barcelona's manager at the
            end of the 2011–12 season. He had been on a rolling contract that
            was renewed annually during his tenure as manager. Citing tiredness
            as the main reason for his decision, he also commented that four
            years at a club like Barcelona felt like an eternity.<br /><br />

            Guardiola continued to lead Barcelona to wins in the remaining La
            Liga games of the season, followed by a 3–0 win in the Copa del Rey
            final. His record of 14 trophies in four seasons has made him the
            most successful manager in Barcelona's history. Barcelona announced
            that he would be succeeded by Tito Vilanova, who would begin leading
            the first team at the start of the 2012–13 season.<br /><br />

            <strong> Luis Enrique Martínez García </strong> (born 8 May 1970),
            known as Luis Enrique, is a Spanish football manager and former
            player. He is the manager of Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain.<br /><br />

            A versatile player with good technique, he was capable of playing in
            several different positions, but usually played as a midfielder or
            forward, and was also noted for his temperament and stamina.
            Starting in 1991 and ending in 2004, he represented both Real Madrid
            and Barcelona with both individual and team success, appearing in
            more than 500 official games and scoring more than 100 goals. He
            appeared with the Spain national team in three World Cups and one
            European Championship.<br /><br />

            Enrique started working as a manager in 2008 with Barcelona B,
            before moving to Roma three years later. In the 2013–14 season he
            managed Celta, before returning to Barcelona and winning the treble
            in his first year and the double in the second; in 2018, he was
            appointed Spain head coach for the first time before resigning for
            family reasons in 2019. He reassumed the position the same year and
            subsequently led the team to the semi-finals of Euro 2020 and second
            place in the 2020–21 Nations League, resigning at the end of the
            2022 World Cup.<br /><br />

            Enrique was born in Gijón, Asturias, and began his career with local
            Sporting de Gijón, where he gained the nickname Lucho after Luis
            Flores, a Mexican forward in the team. He then spent most of his
            playing days with the two biggest Spanish clubs: first Real Madrid
            for five seasons and, in 1996, after seeing out his contract and
            notably scoring in a 5–0 home win against Barcelona in January 1995,
            stating later he "rarely felt appreciated by the Real Madrid
            supporters and didn't have good memories there", he moved to their
            fierce rivals at the Camp Nou on a free transfer. The Catalans'
            supporters were at first hesitant about their new acquisition, but
            he soon won the hearts of the cules, staying eight years, eventually
            becoming team captain and scoring several times in El Clásico
            against his former employers; he passionately celebrated at the
            Santiago Bernabéu, where he grabbed his jersey after a 25-yard
            strike that beat the opposing goalkeeper.<br /><br />

            Enrique netted 46 La Liga goals in his first three seasons with
            Barcelona, with the side finishing runner-up in 1996–97 and
            subsequently winning back-to-back domestic championship accolades.
            Furthermore, he was named Spanish Player of the Year by El País in
            the following campaign. He also scored the opening goal in the 1997
            UEFA Super Cup, a 3–1 aggregate triumph against Borussia
            Dortmund.<br /><br />

            During his final years in Barcelona, Enrique was often injured, and
            did not want to renew his contract. He had been offered a deal by
            his first club Sporting, which he, however, declined, stating that
            "he wouldn't be able to reach the level he demanded of himself" and
            that "he wouldn't be doing Sporting much of a favour by going there.
            His concerns about his level and fitness made him retire on 10
            August 2004 at the age of 34, and he finished his professional
            career with league totals of 400 games and 102 goals, being named by
            Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March.<br /><br />

            On 26 May 2008, Enrique returned to Barcelona, taking over the reins
            of the B team, renamed Barcelona Atlètic for that season. As he
            succeeded long-time Barcelona teammate Pep Guardiola, he stated: "I
            have come home", and "I finished playing here and now I will start
            coaching here."; in his second season he found success, helping the
            club return to Segunda División after an absence of 11 years.<br /><br />

            In mid-March 2011, Enrique announced he would leave at the end of
            the campaign, despite still having two years left on his contract.
            He led the side to the playoffs, but they were ineligible for
            promotion.<br /><br />

            On 19 May 2014, Enrique returned to Barcelona as a manager on a
            two-year deal. He was recommended by sporting director Andoni
            Zubizarreta, his former national teammate. His first competitive
            match was a 3–0 home league win over Elche, where he handed debuts
            to new signings Claudio Bravo, Jérémy Mathieu and Ivan Rakitić, and
            gave youth products Munir El Haddadi, Rafinha and Sandro their
            maiden league appearances for the club, while summer signing Luis
            Suárez was unavailable for selection due to suspension.<br /><br />

            Enrique suffered his first defeat in the competition on 25 October
            2014, away against Real Madrid, and although Barcelona had a
            successful run in the year, his management came under scrutiny
            because of his tactics involving several lineup changes in
            consecutive games. Moreover, a quarrel with Lionel Messi and other
            players further accentuated the team's poor form.<br /><br />

            Amid reports of dressing room unrest, in early January, and on back
            of a defeat to Real Sociedad Zubizarreta was sacked, weakening
            Enrique's standing at the club. A significant upturn in form
            followed, as a result of the coach deciding on a settled lineup with
            a tweak in the formation: Messi and Neymar now played as inverted
            wingers, while Suárez was the lone striker. The team won at home to
            champions Atlético Madrid who had previously defeated them 6 times
            in a row in all competitions. He soon equaled Guardiola's record of
            11 consecutive victories, while the side went on to beat Atlético
            Madrid and Villarreal convincingly in the Copa del Rey to advance to
            the final. In the domestic league, after eight wins in nine matches,
            they returned to the top of the table after 15 weeks.<br /><br />

            On 21 April 2015, Enrique recorded his 42nd win after 50 games in
            charge of Barcelona with a 2–0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain, the
            best record of any manager. He went on to lead the club to the final
            of the UEFA Champions League and, on 17 May, led it to its 23rd
            national championship with one match to spare following a 1–0 win at
            the Vicente Calderón Stadium against Atlético Madrid. On 6 June,
            having earlier won the domestic cup against Athletic Bilbao by the
            same score, the team sealed a treble with a 3–1 defeat of Juventus
            in the Champions League final in Berlin, and three days later he
            signed a new contract until 2017.<br /><br />

            On 11 August 2015, Barcelona won the 2015 UEFA Super Cup 5–4 against
            Sevilla FC. On 2 December, against Villanovense in the Copa del Rey
            round of 32, Enrique decided against bringing on a new player
            following Mathieu's injury with 12 minutes to go even though two
            replacements could still be made, as the score was 6–1 at that time
            and the manager said he did not want to risk introducing players to
            the game without adequate warm-up.<br /><br />

            In his first two seasons, Enrique rotated his goalkeepers, with
            Bravo playing league games and Marc-André ter Stegen playing cup and
            European matches. Both players, however, expressed opposition to
            this policy. A second double was achieved on 22 May 2016, following
            a 2–0 Copa del Rey victory over Sevilla after extra time in which
            the team played more than 50 minutes with one player less, following
            the dismissal of Javier Mascherano.<br /><br />

            On 1 March 2017, Enrique announced that he would not continue as
            team manager after 30 June on the expiration of his contract.<br /><br />

            A huge part of Luis Enrique's success as a Barca coach is owed to
            the trio of strikers he had available in the 2014/15 season. While
            the entire team played a pivotal role, it was the awe-inspiring trio
            of
            <strong>Lionel Messi</strong>, <strong>Neymar Jr.</strong>, and
            <strong>Luis Suárez</strong> that truly ignited the Catalan giants'
            quest for glory. Messi's role as a playmaker was pivotal in crafting
            scoring opportunities for his fellow attackers. Notably, his
            astounding 43 goals and 21 assists across all competitions
            underscored his dual role as both a goal-getter and an assist
            provider. Messi's mere presence on the pitch radiated confidence
            among his teammates and compelled opposing defenses to divert their
            focus, thereby creating vital pockets of space for his partners,
            Neymar and Suárez. Neymar Jr., the Brazilian sensation whose
            effervescent flair and creative flair added a fresh dimension to
            Barcelona's offensive artistry. Characterized by his rapid dribbles,
            audacious footwork, and artistic style of play, Neymar brought an
            electrifying dynamic to the team and managed to score 39 goals and
            10 assists across all competitions. Completing the trio was Luis
            Suárez, the indefatigable Uruguayan striker, renowned for his
            clinical finishing, tireless work ethic, and unrelenting resolve.
            Suárez's robust physicality and relentless pressing disrupted
            opponents' tactical schemes and furnished vital defensive
            contributions. His innate ability to locate the back of the net was
            a game-changing asset, tallying 25 goals and 20 assists across all
            competitions during the treble-winning campaign. <br /><br />
